# LearnPowerShell

This repository contains materials and resources for anyone who wants to learn how to work with Windows PowerShell.
The course is split into 8 modules, each of which contains a presentation with basic information and further files containing exercises.
It can be used for self-paced study or as a resource for teaching PowerShell in class with your students.

The course is conceptualized like a tree:
The first three modules can be regarded as the trunk and the others as (additional) branches.
