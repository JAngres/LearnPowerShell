# LearnPowerShell

This repository contains materials and resources for anyone who wants to learn how to work with Windows PowerShell.
The course is split into 8 modules, each of which contains a presentation with basic information and further files containing exercises.
The ninth chapter is rather specific and therefore only of interest for German educators.

The course can be used for self-paced study or as a resource for teaching PowerShell in class with your students.

All of the presentations (except for the last chapter) are available in German and English.
Some of the exercises are already available in English, too. The file base is continuously updated and in the future there will be English versions of all exercises. (In the meantime, anyone unable to understand German may use translators to read the content of the German files.)

The course structure is conceptualized like a tree:
The first three modules can be regarded as the trunk and the others as (additional) branches.
